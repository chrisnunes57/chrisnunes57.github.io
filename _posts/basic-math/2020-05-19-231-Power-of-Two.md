Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

**Example 1:**

```markdown
Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```markdown
Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```

**Example 3:**

```markdown
Input: 218
Output: false
```





### Solution 1: Bit Counting

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        
        count = 0
        
        while n > 0:
            count += 1
            n = n & (n - 1)
            
        return count == 1
```

This was my initial solution. It takes advantage of the fact that numbers that are powers of two only have one set bit in their binary representation.

For example:

```json
2 => "10"
4 => "100"
8 => "1000"
16 => "10000"
etc...
```

So in order to solve, we count the number of bits that are set to "1" in our number. If `count == 1`{:.language-markdown}, then we know that our number only has one set bit, and therefore is a power of two. 

This solution works very quickly, but there are some trickier ones out there.

### Solution 2: Logarithmic Properties

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        else:
            return int(math.log2(n)) == math.log2(n)
```

This solution works by using Python's built in `log2()`{:.language-markdown} function. If a number is a power of two, then log base 2 will be an integer. 

Examples:

```json
log2(4) = 2
log2(8) = 3
log2(16) = 4
etc....
```

If a number isn't a power of two, then the `log2()`{:.language-markdown} function will return a decimal value. Therefore, we can just test to see whether or not the `log2()`{:.language-markdown} result is the same as it is when we cast it to an int. 

If both numbers are integers, there will be no change when we cast one to an int, and we then know that the original number is a power of two. However, if the number is a decimal, it will not be equal to itself once cast to an int. 

### Solution 3: Bit Counting, but Shorter

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        
        return n > 0 and n & (n - 1) == 0
```

This solution is my favorite, and it takes advantage of another binary property: if a number only has one set bit, then `n & (n - 1) == 0`{:.language-markdown}. 

Let's prove it with the number 8:

```json
binary(8) = 1000
binary(8 - 1) = binary(7) = 0111

binary(8) & binary(7) = 1000 & 0111 = 0
```

Therefore, we can solve the problem by just checking that `n > 0`{:.language-markdown} and `n & (n - 1) == 0`{:.language-markdown}.



#### Notes

These solutions are all pretty quick, and run in constant time. However, the simplest is the third, because it only has to perform three operations: greater than, subtraction, and bitwise AND.
