Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to *n*.

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the  number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which  are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

**Example:**

```python
n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]
```



### Solution 1: Boring

```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        
        result = []
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
                result.append("FizzBuzz")
            elif i % 3 == 0:
                result.append("Fizz")
            elif i % 5 == 0:
                result.append("Buzz")
            else:
                result.append(str(i))
                
        return result
```

Blah. Basic fizzbuzz. No flair. Nothing special.

### Solution 2: Spicy and Pythonic

```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        
        return ["Fizz" * (i % 3 == 0) + "Buzz" * (i % 5 == 0) or str(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
```

Everything about this is pythonic and beautiful. Returning the whole solution in one big list comprehension? Check ✅. Multiplying strings by the ouput of boolean expressions? Check ✅. Having one line of code that's 100 characters long? Check ✅.

I would maybe not solve it this way in an interview.



#### Notes

Fizzbuzz is a decently popular programming question. People use it because it's pretty easy to understand, and it weeds out people who don't actually know how to program.
