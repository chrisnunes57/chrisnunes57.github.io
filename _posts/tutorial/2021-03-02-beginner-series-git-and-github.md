# Introduction

Welcome to the Beginner Series! This is a series of posts designed to introduce people to different concepts and technologies that I think are cool or useful.

This tutorial will give you a brief overview of how to get started with Git. Git is a tool that is used for version control and collaboration, and it is an essential part of working on any large coding project. 

In this guide, we will be going over how to do some basic operations: 

  - Creating a new "repository"
  - Downloading your repository to your local machine
  - Making changes to the repository
  - "Pushing" your local changes
  - "Pulling" any remote changes

There are a lot of features that Git provides, but these are the most basic ones, and are all that you need to get started!

# Prerequisite: Install Git and create a Github Account

Before we can start working with Git, we need to actually install it on our computer! You can go to [this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git){:target="_blank"} to learn how to install Git on your specific operating system.

Once you've done that step, you should be able to use Git on your computer. You can confirm that this works by typing `git --version`{:.language-bash} in your terminal. 

You should see output like `git version 2.24.1 (Apple Git-126)`{:.language-markdown}. If you see something like `command not found: git`{:.language-markdown}, then the installation probably did not work and you should try again.

After this step, we want to create a [Github](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} account. Github is a website that lets you host your code and collaborate on projects with others. You can think of it as something like Google Drive, where you can upload your projects, download them, and share projects with others.

# Step 1: Creating a Repository on Github

Each Git project is called a "repository". A repository tracks all the changes that you make to your code, and allows you to use Git features like "pushing" and "pulling". To create a new repository, go to [github.com/new/](https://github.com/new/){:target="_blank"}.

Once on that page, you should see this view:

![A screen showing fields that you must fill out in order to create a new Git repository](/assets/img/git-intro/new-repo.png)
<p class="caption">These are the steps to create a new repository</p>

You have to fill out this form to create a new Git repository. You can fill out most of these fields with whatever you want, such as **Repository name** and **Description**. However, when creating this first repository, make sure that the **"Add a README file"** box is checked.

![An option called "Add a README file, with the checkbox clicked and selected](/assets/img/git-intro/add-readme.png)
<p class="caption">Select the "Add a README file" option</p>

This will create a single file called `README.md`{:.language-markdown} in your repository, instead of creating a new empty repository. The `README.md`{:.language-markdown} is the first thing people see when they view your repository on Github, so it is a great place to put a description of your project, or instructions on how to use it.

# Step 2: Cloning Your Repository

Now that our repository is created on Github, we are in an interesting situation. Our repository exists **remotely** on Github, but it doesn't exist **locally** on our personal computer. Imagine a file that exists on Google Drive, but you don't have on your computer. So, our next step is to download our repository to our local computer.

When working with Git, downloading/copying a repository to our computer is referred to as **"cloning"** the repository. From here on out, that is how I will be referring to it.

To clone our repository from Github, we need to view the repository online. It should already be pulled up in your browser after creating the repository, but if it isn't, you can go to `https://github.com/<your_username>?tab=repositories`{:.language-markdown} and click on a specific repository.

When you have a specific repository open, you should see this view (with a different repository name and username):

![A view of a newly created Git repository. It shows all the files in the repository, as well as the name and description](/assets/img/git-intro/repo-view.png)
<p class="caption">Your empty repository!</p>

This shows you all the files that are in your repository, as well as other information such as the repository name, the description, and other useful things. This is a nice page to go to find any information you need about a repository. 

To clone our repository, all we care about is the green button that says **Code**. If you click on it, it will open a little window showing you different ways to clone your repository. 

![A window showing different ways to clone a Git repository. The options are HTTPS, SSH, or Github CLI](/assets/img/git-intro/clone-repo.png)
<p class="caption">You want the url that starts off "https://github.com/your_username/...."</p>

These options (HTTPS, SSH, and Github CLI) all have different uses, but for this tutorial, we will use HTTPS. To clone your repository, first copy the URL that it shows you in the dialogue box. 

Then, open up a terminal window on your computer and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For instance, you could navigate to your desktop directory. 

Then, enter the command `git clone <github_url>`{:.language-markdown}, where `<github_url>`{:.language-markdown} is the HTTPS url that you copied a moment ago. If everything is set up correctly, the repository will be cloned, and you will see the following:

![A terminal screen showing the output of the git clone command. It shows how many files were downloaded, and that it successfully cloned the repository](/assets/img/git-intro/clone-output.png)
<p class="caption">Cloning Git repository from the terminal</p>

Once that command successfully executes, the repository will be on your computer, and there will be a folder on your computer with all the repository files on it. 

If you know where this repository is located on your computer, you can skip to [Step 4](#step-4-editing-your-files). If not, Step 3 will tell you how to find your repository!

# Step 3: Finding Your Files

If you're not familiar with Git or using your terminal, your first question will probably be something like "Where did the files get downloaded? How do I find them?". These are fair questions that we need to resolve before moving on. 

Rather than doing a scavenger hunt to find the files, we're going to run a command to find where the repository was downloaded. In your terminal where you just cloned the repository, run the command that matches your computer:

  - MacOS/Linux: `pwd`{:.language-markdown}
  - Windows: `cd`{:.language-markdown}

These commands will both output one line containing the current directory. The current directory also happens to be the directory where we just cloned our repository! We can use this info to find where our repository is in our file system.

So for example, if `pwd `{:.language-markdown} or `cd`{:.language-markdown} tell you that you're in the directory `Users/Chris/Desktop`{:.language-markdown}, and the name of your repository is `test-repo`{:.language-markdown}, then the path to the repository will be `Users/Chris/Desktop/test-repo`{:.language-markdown}.

Once our files are located, we can go to the next step, which is opening our files to edit them.

# Step 4: Editing Your Files

If you're following this tutorial, you're probably at least somewhat familiar with writing code. At the very least, you've edited a file before. All that we're doing in this step is editing our README.md file so that we have some changes to push to Git.

To begin, open the recently cloned README.md file in any kind of text editor. Change your file so that it looks something like this:

```markdown
# My first Github Repository!

I am learning how to use Git and Github, and this is my first repository!
```

The specifics don't matter, we just want to make sure it's different than it was before. **Save your changes**, and we're ready for the next step!

# Step 5: Pushing Your Local Changes to Git

Right now, we have **local** changes on our computer, but our **remote** repository doesn't have the changes. This is consistent with our Google Drive Analogy. If you download a file from Google Drive and edit it, the version of the file on Google Drive won't be changed until you re-upload the file.

So logically, once we've made our local changes, the next step is to **"push"** the changes to the remote version. However, first we need to learn about Git ***commits***. A Git commit is like a milestone or checkpoint along the timeline of a Git project. When you make a commit, you are encapsulating all the changes that have been made since the previous commit.

Another important Git concept is ***adding*** files to Git. While Git automatically tracks all the changes you make to your files, it won't actually care about the changes unless you use the `git add`{:.language-markdown} command. Using `git add <filename>`{:.language-markdown} tells Git that you want to include the `<filename>`{:.language-markdown} file in the next commit.

With those two concepts in mind, here is how the process of pushing local changes to Github works:

  1. Tell Git which changes you want to add, using the `git add <filename>`{:.language-markdown} command
  2. Create a single commit to summarize the changes you have made using the `git commit -m "<message>"`{:.language-markdown}
  3. Finally, push our new commit (and all the changes it contains) to our remote repository using `git push`{:.language-markdown}

### Example Add/Commit/Push

We'll use our changes to `README.md`{:.language-markdown} to demonstrate how this works. At this point, your `README.md`{:.language-markdown} file should be updated with more text, like this:

```markdown
# My first Github Repository!

I am learning how to use Git and Github, and this is my first repository!
```

Now that the change is done, we should make sure that Git has noticed. In your terminal window, navigate into the git repository. Once there, run `git status`{:.language-markdown}. You should see something like this:

![A terminal screen showing the output of the git status command. It shows that there is one modified file, and that it is not currently added to Git](/assets/img/git-intro/git-status.png)
<p class="caption">The modified file is highlighted in red</p>

As we can see, Git sees that `README.md`{:.language-markdown} has been modified. We can also see that Git says that there are "no changes added to commit". We can fix this by using the command `git add README.md`{:.language-markdown}. This command should give back no output (if all goes well).

Once you have added the `README.md`{:.language-markdown} file, re-run `git status`{:.language-markdown} to see what has changed.

![A terminal screen showing the output of the git status command. It shows that there is still one modified file, and that it is now ready to be committed](/assets/img/git-intro/git-status-2.png)
<p class="caption">Now that we have used 'git add', the file is green</p>

Now, our modified `README.md`{:.language-markdown} is now ready to be committed! To commit the change, we use the `git commit -m "<message>"`{:.language-markdown} command, where `<message>`{:.language-markdown} is an informative message describing what changes were made. 

To commit the `README.md`{:.language-markdown} changes, I would use the command `git commit -m "updated README with repo description"`{:.language-markdown}. As you can see, the message doesn't have to be particularly formal or long, it only has to describe the changes made.

![A terminal screen showing the output of the git commit command. It shows that there is one change included in the new commit](/assets/img/git-intro/git-commit.png)
<p class="caption">Using 'git commit' with a commit message</p>

Once you have run the `git commit`{:.language-markdown} command, we are ready to push our code to the remote repository. This command is simple: `git push`{:.language-markdown}. Running this command should give the following output: 

![A terminal screen showing the output of the git push command. It shows many changes were uploaded, and that the operation was a success](/assets/img/git-intro/git-push.png)
<p class="caption">A lot of nonsense, but no errors!</p>

If all goes well, our change should be pushed to the remote repository! We can easily verify that the changes are present by opening/refreshing the repository page on Github. Now that the `README.md`{:.language-markdown} is changed, so has the repository web page!

![A web page showing information about our repository. The description of the repository now shows the changes that we just uploaded](/assets/img/git-intro/repo-final.png)
<p class="caption">Our repository shows our changes!</p>

Woohoo! Let's review what we've done. 

  - Created a repository on Github
  - Cloned the repository to our local machine
  - Edited one of the files in the repository
  - Added the changed file to our next commit using `git add`{:.language-markdown}
  - Created a new commit of our changes using `git commit`{:.language-markdown}
  - Pushed our local changes to Github using `git push`{:.language-markdown}

On top of all of this, there is one more important skill that we need to learn in order to collaborate using Git. We have learned how to add our local changes and push them to the remote repository, but we don't know how to ***pull*** remote changes onto our local machine.

We could do this by re-cloning the repository every time we wanted new changes, but this would cause us to lose any local changes that we hadn't saved, and it would be very overkill. As it turns out, there is a way to pull *only* the changed files from the remote repository, instead of re-cloning the entire repository.

# Step 6: Pulling Remote Changes to Your Local Machine

We can **pull** changed files onto our local machine by using the `git pull`{:.language-markdown} command. This command will download all the changed files in the remote repository to your local repository. 

This command is very useful when working on projects with other people! For example, if you are working on a project with a friend, you can both just push your own code and pull the other's code easily.

Fun fact: before I knew how to use Git, my friends and I would always send code back and forth through email or Facebook chat. Git has made collaboration much faster and better!

### Creating a Remote Change

In order to actually demonstrate the `git pull`{:.language-markdown} command, we need changes in our remote repository that do not exist locally. So, we need to edit our remote repository using the Github web interface.

To do this, view your repository on Github and find the "Edit README" button on the main page (circled in red).

![A web page showing information about our repository. There is a circle around a button that will let you edit your README file.](/assets/img/git-intro/edit-repo.png)
<p class="caption">Click on the pen icon circled in red</p>

Click on this button, and it will take you to a screen where you can edit your `README.md`{:.language-markdown} file. For the sake of this example, just change your `README.md`{:.language-markdown} file in some noticeable way.

For example, I edited my file to look like this:

```markdown
# My first Github Repository!

I am learning how to use Git and Github, and this is my first repository!

I made this change from Github.com! :0
```

Once you've edited the text to something you like, scroll down until you find the "Commit Changes" section of the page.

![A dialogue box prompting you to enter a message, and then commit your changes.](/assets/img/git-intro/commit-repo.png)
<p class="caption">Add your commit message here</p>

Just like we had to provide a commit message when using `git commit -m "<message>"`{:.language-markdown}, we will also need to provide a message when we make changes online. Once again, the message can be something simple, like `"Changed README from Github"`{:.language-markdown}. 

Once you add your message, click the "Commit Changes" button and your changes will be saved. 

Now that we have a new change on our remote branch, we need to figure out how to get that change on our local branch as well!

### Pulling a Remote Change

Now that we have a change in the remote repository, we need to download, or ***pull***, the change to our local repository. 

To do this, navigate using your terminal to the git repository that we were working in before. This will be the same folder where we ran the `git clone`{:.language-markdown}, `git add`{:.language-markdown} and `git push`{:.language-markdown} commands earlier.

Once there, we just need to run one command: `git pull`{:.language-markdown}. This will download all the changes from the remote repository that we do not currently have on our local machine.

If the command is executed successfully, you will see an output similar to the output from `git push`{:.language-markdown} or `git clone`{:.language-markdown}.

![A terminal screen showing the output of the git pull command. It shows that there is one newly-modified file, and that is was updated with a new change.](/assets/img/git-intro/git-pull.png)
<p class="caption">We can see the new changes highlighted in green</p>

Now if you open your `README.md`{:.language-markdown} file in a text editor, you'll see that the file has the new edit that you made on Github!

# Conclusion

Now you know the basics of Git! In your everyday use, you will mainly use `git add`{:.language-markdown}, `git commit`{:.language-markdown}, and `git push`{:.language-markdown}. However, there is a massive world of Git uses that we didn't cover in this tutorial, and you'll likely run into them in the future when you start collaborating with Git.

To continue learning, I would recommend putting all of your projects into a Git repository and hosting them on Github! This is a useful way to back up your projects, and also a good way to flex your projects to your friends (and recruiters!)
