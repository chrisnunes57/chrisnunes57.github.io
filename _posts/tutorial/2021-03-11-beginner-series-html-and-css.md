# Introduction

Welcome to the Beginner Series! This is a series of posts designed to introduce people to different concepts and technologies that I think are cool or useful.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of coding your first website from scratch. By the time you're finished reading, you should know how to create a **.html** file, create a website using HTML and CSS code, and then open your **.html** file to view it in a web browser!

There are many different technologies that go into making a website work, but HTML and CSS are both essential in the layout and design of websites.

# Background: HTML/CSS vs Programming Languages

To understand what HTML and CSS are, it is important to know the difference between ***programming*** languages and ***markup*** languages.

If you have ever done any kind of programming before in languages like C++, Python, Java, etc., then you have used a programminng language! Programming languages let you do all kinds of fancy things, such as using data structures, writing loops, using conditional logic, and much more.

HTML and CSS, though they are used to write code, are **not** programming languages. Instead, HTML is a ***markup*** language and CSS is a ***style sheet*** language. You don't have to know what these mean, but it good to be familiar with the idea that these aren't ***programming*** languages. 

Whereas programming languages can be used for writing a huge variety of programs, HTML and CSS will only ever be used for designing webpages.

# HTML vs CSS

Though HTML and CSS are almost always used in tandem, they are very different from each other. They are used used differently, and have very different purposes. Put simply, HTML is used for the *structure* and *layout* of the website, while CSS is used for *styling* the website and making it look good.

Every single website we see online is a combination of HTML and CSS. However, if we look at a website without HTML or CSS, we can easily see the difference between them. Here are three different views of my website: one with only HTML, one with only CSS, and one with both.
